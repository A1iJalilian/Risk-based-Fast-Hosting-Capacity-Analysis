    "## Overview\n",
    "The `reduce_size` function reduces the size of an electrical network by removing specific buses and updating the connections between lines based on certain conditions. This function is useful for simplifying network models while preserving essential connectivity and properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs\n",
    "- `eng`: A dictionary representing the electrical network. This dictionary contains information about buses and lines in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "- A modified version of the `eng` dictionary with certain buses and lines removed, and the remaining lines updated to maintain network connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functionality\n",
    "1. **Helper Function**: `find_lines_connected_to_bus(eng, bus_id)` - Finds and returns a list of lines connected to a given bus.\n",
    "2. **Iterate Over Buses**: The function loops through each bus in the network to identify candidates for removal.\n",
    "3. **Check Conditions**:\n",
    "   - The bus has no load connected to it.\n",
    "   - The bus connects exactly two lines.\n",
    "   - The two lines have the same \"linecode\".\n",
    "4. **Update Line Information**: If all conditions are met, the function:\n",
    "   - Adds the bus to a removal list.\n",
    "   - Merges the lengths of the two lines.\n",
    "   - Updates the `f_bus` and `t_bus` connections for the remaining line.\n",
    "5. **Remove Redundant Lines and Buses**: The function deletes the redundant line and all marked buses from the network.\n",
    "6. **Return Modified Network**: The modified network dictionary is returned.\n"
